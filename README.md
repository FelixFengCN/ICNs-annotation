üì¶ Original Data and Processing
ICN template:
Neuromark_fMRI_1.0 template available at: http://trendscenter.org/software/gift

Transcriptomic data (AHBA):
From http://human.brain-map.org, processed using the abagen toolbox

Single-nucleus RNA-seq data:
Available at: CellXGene (https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/d17249d2-0e6e-4500-abb8-e6c93fa1ac6f), processed and deconvoluted using BayesPrism
The resulting cell-type maps were accessible at https://trendscenter.org/data/.

üìÅ Data Files (in data/)

f_ic_6_celltype_t3.mat

    ic: Spatial values of the 6th IC overlapping with AHBA samples

    ic_null: 1,000 spatial permutations (Moran test via BrainSpace)

    celltype: Spatial values from 24 cell-type maps

    centroids: Spatial coordinates

f_ic_6_mitochondrion_t3.mat

    ic: Spatial values of the 6th IC overlapping with mitochondrial maps

    ic_null: 1,000 spatial permutations (via BrainSpace) (not included due to file size)

    mitochondrion: Spatial values from 6 mitochondrial maps

    centroids: Spatial coordinates

Note: Neurotransmitter test file is not included due to size but follows the same structure as the mitochondrial file.

üß† Code Overview (in Codes/)

analysis_ic_celltype_corr_f.m

Computes spatial correlations between ICNs and cell-type maps.

analysis_ic_mitochondral_multiplecorr.R

Computes correlations between ICNs and mitochondrial maps, and performs relative importance analysis using the relaimpo R package.

analysis_ic_neurotransmitter_multiplecorr.R

Performs correlation and importance analysis for neurotransmitter maps.

clustering.py

Performs network clustering and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) calculation.
Diffusion embedding from BrainSpace is used to project similarity networks into a shared space.
K-means clustering groups the projected connections, and ARI quantifies the consistency with functional domain labels.

analysis_mediation.R

Conducts mediation analysis using the PROCESS module in R.
Cellular/molecular maps are predictors, cognitive probabilistic measures are outcomes, and ICNs serve as mediators.
